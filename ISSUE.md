# Issue & Solution Documentation: Handling Text Overflow in Flutter

## Issue: Text Overflow
When developing a Flutter application, a common issue is that `Text` can overflow beyond the screen limits, especially with long strings or text without spaces. This affects the UI aesthetics and user readability, reducing the quality of the user experience.

## Solution: Using ConstrainedBox to Wrap Text

### 1. Introduction to ConstrainedBox
`ConstrainedBox` is a Flutter widget that lets you set size constraints for its child widgets. When combined with `Text`, it can limit the width and prevent the text from spilling over the screen edges.

### 2. Implementation

In the following example, `ConstrainedBox` is used to restrict `Text` within a defined width:

```dart

    body: Center(
        child: ConstrainedBox(
                constraints: BoxConstraints(maxWidth: 300),
                child: Text(
                    'This is a very long text string that could overflow the screen if not constrained.',
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
                maxLines: 3, // This is the line of code that allows the text to be displayed
                overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
            ),
        ),
    )
    
```
