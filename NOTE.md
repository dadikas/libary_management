# Dependency Injection Design Pattern in Dart

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the **Dependency Injection** design pattern in Dart. The purpose of Dependency Injection is to manage the dependencies of a class by providing them externally, instead of creating them within the class. This promotes loose coupling and makes the code easier to test, maintain, and extend.

In this example, we will explore how Dependency Injection works in Dart by simulating a small application that fetches data from either an API service or a database service.

## Key Concepts

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: A software design pattern where an objectâ€™s dependencies are provided externally, rather than being created inside the object.
- **Loose Coupling**: DI helps reduce dependencies between classes, making the code easier to modify and extend.
- **Testability**: DI makes it easier to test your classes by allowing you to inject mock dependencies.
